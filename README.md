## Stroke Prediction with ML:
### I created a stroke prediction model in this notebook.
## About Dataset
### A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications.
### The dataset used was used to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. 
### Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
